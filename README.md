# Dynamic-CRUD-implementation
Example Razor pages project implementing dynamic CRUD functionality. This solution is a very basic example so the author can learn.

CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic operations for managing data in a persistent storage system (like a database):
•	Create: Add new records (e.g., inserting a new row in a table).
•	Read: Retrieve or view existing records (e.g., displaying data in a list or detail view).
•	Update: Modify existing records (e.g., editing a row’s values).
•	Delete: Remove records (e.g., deleting a row from a table).
